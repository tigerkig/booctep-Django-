Hello there,
I'm glad to notice you about the workflow on this repository.

# Create your branch
$ git checkout -b

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "comment here"

$ git push -u origin


Before merging to main branch, you need to create pull request on your branch.


[1] Will check your updates and merge them on my side


[1] deploy the final version to heroku.


[2] don't push the assets like video and images because heroku max size is under 500 MB.


HAPPY CODDING! BEST OF LUCK!
